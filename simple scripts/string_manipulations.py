# CSV module. We do not need to use split() to manually parse CSV files. The csv module is available.

# Rsplit. Usually rsplit() is the same as split. The only difference occurs when the second argument is specified.
# This limits the number of times a string is separated.
# So:  When we specify 3, we split off only three times from the right. This is the maximum number of splits that occur.
# Tip: The first element in the result list contains all the remaining, non-separated string values. This is unprocessed data.
# Data :
s = "Buffalo;Rochester;Yonkers;Syracuse;Albany;Schenectady"

# Tuple: This has three parts. It has the left part, the delimiter character, and the remaining string data.
# Also: The rpartition() method is available. It acts from the right of the string, rather than the left. Partition is "lpartition."
