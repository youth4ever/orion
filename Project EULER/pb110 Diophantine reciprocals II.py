            Diophantine reciprocals II          -           Problem 110

In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.
                    1 / x  +  1 / y  =  1 / n

It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of n
for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.

What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million (4*10**6)   ?

NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of Problem 108 and as it is well beyond the limitations
of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.

############## GENERAL IDEAS #################
# ==== Mon, 13 Jan 2014, 18:23, PhilLeTaxi, France
# I solved this problem without programming.
#
# I have used the formula that gives the number of solutions :
# 4000000=((2a_1+1)(2a_2+1)...(2a_k+1)+1)/2
# This is equivalent to :
# 7999999=(2a1+1)(2a2+1)...(2ak+1)
#
# It's easy to see that : 7999999=7×199×57437999999=7×199×5743
#
# Then I have searched the nearest product of odd numbers and I have found :
# 8037225=3**8×5**2×7**2
#
# Knowing this, the smallest number for 4000000 solutions is :
# 23×33×52×72×11×13×17×19×23×29×31×37
#
# Many thanks for all the hints and explanations on the forum.

# About 6 ms, and 12 ms for nn=4 billion. Same code as for p108. No prior knowledge of prime factors is assumed.
#
# I recast the given formula into the form
# y=n**2*k+n
#  where k=x−n. It follows that kk must be a divisor of n2.
# If the prime factors of n**2 are p_1**2a p_2**2b p_3**2c...p1 p2 p3... where p1,p2,p3, are the primes and a≥b≥c...,
# then there will be (2a+1)(2b+1)(2c+1).. divisors.
# If this number is dd, then the number of distinct solutions for (x,y),
# given that we do not distinguish them from solutions for (y,x), is (d+1)/2.
# The problem then is to find the smallest value of n=p1**a *p2**b * p3**c... such that d>2m−1,
# where m is the minimum number of solutions that the equation is required to have, 4,000,000 in this case.
#
# We are looking for a highly divisible number, which will likely have several prime factors,
# each with a low exponent. In my code, I don't assume this, but do choose a maximum possible value
# for the exponent of p1, then find the minimum value of nn for each of the possible values of
# p1**a *p2**b * p3**c..., starting with only two prime factors,
# such that our criterion d>2m−1 is met, then increment the maximum exponent and repeat,
# then repeat this up to the maximum number of prime factors that n**2 can possibly have.
# So, for example, if I were testing with three prime factors, and allowed the exponent a to have the value 3,
# then I would be testing for a,b,ca,b,c values (1,1,1),(2,1,1),(2,2,1),(2,2,2),(3,1,1),(3,2,1),(3,3,1),(3,2,2),(3,3,2) and (3,3,3).
# The trick to not missing the lowest possible value of nn was to to test in ascending order of values of p1**a *p2**b * p3**c..
#
# I had trouble on large numbers with the np.prod() function for finding products of elements of a list.
# On replacing it with my own not very Pythonic code I got more speed and
# it still worked for large n. n=4 trillion takes 26 ms!

# Using what I learned in 108 (d(n**2)+1) /2>4,000,000  I figured I could do this one
# by guessing the exponents of the prime factorization.  I used logarithms to guess starting values:
#
# (s_i+1)m>8,000,000 where s_i=2
# log_10(2+1)**m=log_10 (8,000,000)
# m=log_10(8,000,000)/log_10 (3)
# m=14.46820890645068 so will need ~ 15 prime terms for the top range of possible product candidates.
#
# I started with: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47 but this number was too large
# and returned too many results.
# Since I had too many prime factors, I had to remove large factors (e.g., 47)
# and replace with smaller ones (e.g., 2^2 * 3*2).
# Sure enough, after fiddling around with a dozen or so tries,
# I got an answer above 4M.
# See my final prime factorization in the code below.
