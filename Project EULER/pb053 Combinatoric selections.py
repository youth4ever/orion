Combinatoric selections     -       Problem 53
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:
           123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345
In combinatorics, we use the notation, nCr(5,3) = 10.
In general,
nCr(n,r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where r =< n, n! = n * (n1) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1, and 0! = 1.
It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: nCr(23,10) = 1144066.
How many values of nCr(n,r), for 1 =< n =< 100, are greater than one-million?
