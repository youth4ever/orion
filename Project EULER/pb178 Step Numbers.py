Step Numbers        -       Problem 178

Consider the number 45656.
It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a difference of one.
A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of one is called a step number.
A pandigital number contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least once.
How many pandigital step numbers less than 10**40 are there?

'''
import time

### LOGIC ###
We only have to start from 10**9 == 10-digit number up
Question : How many pandigital numbers are in 10-digit ?
A: Because it cannot start with 0 we will have 9*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 9*9!
Q2 : How many step-numbers are in a 10-digit number ?  NO DEGREE OF LIBERTY !
 A2 : Can't start with 0 but we can with 9 ==> 987.654.321.0
we can't have  897.654.321.0 or 123.456.789.0 because it is not step-number => therefore we only have 1 pand-step-nr in 10-dig !

Q3 : What about in a 11-digit number ? Again. Can't start with 0
A3 : Here we have +1 degree of liberty => but still can't start with lower numbers because :
        345.678.987.65 is not a valid step number =>
    We have : 987.654.321.01 , 898.465.321.01, 101.234.567.89,  => 3 pand-step-numbers   !!!

Q4 : 12-digits ?  2 degrees of liberty
A4 : We have :  989.876.543.210
                        987.654.321.012 , 987.654.321.010 , 987.654.321.210, 987.654.323.210
                        898.765.432.101
                        789.876.543.210
                        101.234.567.898, 120.123.456.789 ,
                        210.123.456.789,
