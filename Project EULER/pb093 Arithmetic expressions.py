                                                        Arithmetic expressions      -       Problem 93
By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the
four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive INTEGER targets.

For example,

                                                                        8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2
                                                                        14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)
                                                                        19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1
                                                                        36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)

Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.

Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum,
and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.

Find the set of four distinct digits, a < b < c < d, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to n,
can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: abcd.

# As others have done, I implemented reverse polish evaluation.
# The nice part is that there is no need to figure out where the parentheses go, because there aren't any!
# In reverse polish, the order of the operands are always the same as in  the infix expression.
# Also, the last item must be an operator, and in this case, the first two must be operands
# ( because all of the operators require two operands).
# Finally, going left to right, the number operands to the left of any point must be greater than the number of operators.
# This leaves just 5 possible formulae.  In the following, the capital letters A,B,C,D are operands,
# and the lowercase letters x,y, and z are operations.
# The 5 formulae are : ABCDxyz,ABCxDyz,ABCxyDz,ABxCDyz,ABxCyDz.
# Now just iterate of all permutations of the digits 1 thru 9 , and the 4 operations, and keep track of the results.
# I implemented in Python, and kept the interpreted reverse polish evaluation function, so it took a few seconds to complete.

# Well, Reverse Polish Notation is just brilliant - pity I never heard of it before solving this problem!
# Thank you Project Euler for enlightening me!
#
# My Python code is very many nested loops:
# combinations of 4 digits -> permutations of those -> options for op1, op2, op3 -> 5 ways of putting brackets into A op1 B op2 C op3 D
#
# I wish I'd thought of using functions like this:
# sO3SrLCr4Rqb00Zr4nIYCVBPZ_oFimST said
# In python, functions themselves can be passed as objects (or rather, they *are* objects),
# and you can even assign them to a variable and then call that variable as though it were a function.
#
# e.g.
# def somefunc(a, b):
#     return a+b
#
# newname = somefunc
# newname(1, 2)
#
# I used this to my advantage to make an (in my opinion) elegant solution:
# By the way, to those expressing a wish that their choice of language supported "eval":
# I was always taught that "eval is evil".
# It's never necessary, and it's a huge vector for failure.
# It's better to go the Euler route and relish the challenge of finding another way!

# Then I happened upon Catalan numbers and Dyck words and so on.
# As it stands, I have to put the first 3 of those possibilities in manually
