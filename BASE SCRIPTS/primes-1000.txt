Python script to find the first 1000 prime numbers
By Robert Huberdeau November 22, 2011

EDITED 2/21
I received an email from Warrick Holfeld that pointed out a few errors in my script. I was including 1 as a prime number, which is incorrect. I was missing the number 2, as I skipped it, and I was only getting the first 999 prime numbers. Warrick's updated code is below.

I recently found out that MIT has some course material online for free. This includes lectures, projects and exams ( depending on the class ). I decided to take a look and so far I've watched the first Introduction to Computer Science class. Even though I work in tech, my degree is in psychology, so I thought this wouldn't be an awful class to start with.

The scripting language used for this class is Python. I had no experience with Python so I'm learning as I'm going.
The first real homework assignment is to write a script to find the first 1,000 prime numbers.
This was a lot harder than I thought it would be- after a couple of hours, this is what I came up with:
'''

prime_count = 1
start_number = 2
number_to_check = 2
while prime_count <= 1000:
    result = number_to_check % start_number

    if result > 0:
        start_number +=1

    elif result == 0:
        if start_number == number_to_check:
            print (number_to_check)
            number_to_check +=1
            prime_count +=1
            start_number =2
        else:
            number_to_check +=1
            start_number = 2
'''
The % command divides two integers and returns the remainder. So,  I start at 1 and then use a series of checks. 
If the remainder is greater than zero, then I increment the count. So 5 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. In this case, I move from dividing by 3 to 4.
If the result is zero and I'm dividing a number by itself, then I've found a prime number and increment in the prime number count, move to the next number and reset the divider back to 1.
Otherwise, if the result is zero and the denominator is less than the numerator and I'm not dividing by 1, then I move to the next number. So, if I divide 9 by 3, I get a zero and move to the next number. 
If I am dividing by 1, then I increment the divider by 1
