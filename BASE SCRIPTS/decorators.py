# ==== Introduction
#
# decorators Decorators belong most probably to the most beautiful and most powerful design possibilities in Python,
# but at the same time the concept is considered by many as complicated to get into.
# To be precise, the usage of decorates is very easy, but writing decorators can be complicated,
# especially if you are not experienced with decorators and some functional programming concepts.
#
# Even though it is the same underlying concept, we have two different kinds of decorators in Python:
# Function decorators
# Class decorators
# A decorator in Python is any callable Python object that is used to modify a function or a class.
# A reference to a function "func" or a class "C" is passed to a decorator and the decorator returns a modified function or class.
# The modified functions or classes usually contain calls to the original function "func" or class "C".
#
# You may also consult our chapter on memoization with decorators.
#
# If you like the image on the right side of this page and if you are also interested in image processing with Python,
#     Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib, you will definitely like our chapter on Image Processing Techniques,
#     it explains the whole process of the making-of of our decorator and at sign picture!

print('\n---------------  First Steps to Decorators --------------------')
# ==== First Steps to Decorators
# We know from our various Python training classes that there are some sticking points in the definitions of decorators,
# where many beginners get stuck.
#
# Therefore, we wil will introduce decorators by repeating some important aspects of functions.
# First you have to know or remember that function names are references to functions
# and that we can assign multiple names to the same function:

def succ(x):
    return x + 1

successor = succ
print(successor(10) )
print(succ(10) )

# This means that we have two names, i.e. "succ" and "successor" for the same function.
# The next important fact is that we can delete either "succ" or "successor" without deleting the function itself.
del succ
print(successor(10) )

# ====Functions inside Functions
print('\n---------------  Functions inside Functions --------------------')
# The concept of having or defining functions inside of a function is completely new to C or C++ programmers:
def f():
    def g():
        print("Hi, it's me 'g'")
        print("Thanks for calling me")

    print("This is the function 'f'")
    print("I am calling 'g' now:")
    g()

f()

print('\n"proper" return statements')
# Another example using "proper" return statements in the functions:
def temperature(t):
    def celsius2fahrenheit(x):
        return 9 * x / 5 + 32

    result = "It's " + str(celsius2fahrenheit(t)) + " degrees!"
    return result

print(temperature(20))


# ==== Functions as Parameters
print('\n---------------  Functions as Parameters --------------------')

# If you solely look at the previous examples, this doesn't seem to be very useful .
# It gets useful in combination with two further powerful possibilities of Python functions.
# Due to the fact that every parameter of a function is a reference to an object and functions are objects as well,
# we can pass functions - or better "references to functions" - as parameters to a function.
# We will demonstrate this in the next simple example:

def g():
    print("Hi, it's me 'g'")
    print("Thanks for calling me")

def f(func):
    print("Hi, it's me 'f'")
    print("I will call 'func' now")
    func()

f(g)

print()
# You may not be satisfied with the output. 'f' should write that it calls 'g' and not 'func'.
# Of course, we need to know what the 'real' name of func is.
# For this purpose, we can use the attribute __name__, as it contains this name:

def g():
    print("Hi, it's me 'g'")
    print("Thanks for calling me")

def f(func):
    print("Hi, it's me 'f'")
    print("I will call 'func' now")
    func()
    print("func's real name is " + func.__name__)

f(g)

print('\n -----------   Another example: -------------- ')

import math

def foo(func):
    print("The function " + func.__name__ + " was passed to foo")
    res = 0
    for x in [1, 2, 2.5]:
        res += func(x)
    return res

print(foo(math.sin))
print(foo(math.cos))


# ======Functions returning Functions
print('\n---------------  Functions returning Functions--------------------')
# The output of a function is also a reference to an object. Therefore functions can return references to function objects.

def f(x):
    def g(y):
        return y + x + 3
    return g

nf1 = f(1)
nf2 = f(3)

print( nf1(1) )         # will print 5
print( nf2(1) )         # will print 7


# We will implement a polynomial "factory" function now. We will start with writing a version which can create polynomials of degree 2.
print('\n------------ polynomial "factory" function  --------------')


# The Python implementation as a polynomial factory function can be written like this:
# p(x) = a*x**2 + b*x + c


def polynomial_creator(a, b, c):
    def polynomial(x):
        return a * x**2 + b * x + c
    return polynomial

p1 = polynomial_creator(2, 3, -1)
p2 = polynomial_creator(-1, 2, 1)

for x in range(-2, 2 ):
    print('x=',x, '      p1(x)=',p1(x), '        p2(x)=',p2(x) )


print('\n------------ polynomials of arbitrary degree  --------------')

# We can generalize our factory function so that it can work for polynomials of arbitrary degree:

# Î£ {k=0, n} a_k * x**k = a_n*x**k + a_(n-1)*x**(n-1) +... + a_2*x**2 + a_1*x + a_0

def polynomial_creator(*coefficients):
    def polynomial(x):
        res = 0
        degree = len(coefficients) - 1
        for index, coeff in enumerate(coefficients):
            res += coeff * x**(degree - index)
        return res
    return polynomial

p1 = polynomial_creator(4)
p2 = polynomial_creator(2, 4)
p3 = polynomial_creator(2, 3, -1, 8, 1)
p4 = polynomial_creator(-1, 2, 1)


for x in range(-2, 2, 1):
    print(x, p1(x), p2(x), p3(x), p4(x))


# ===== A Simple Decorator
print('\n------------ A Simple Decorator  --------------')
# Now we have everything ready to define our first simple decorator:

def our_decorator(func):
    def function_wrapper(x):
        print("Before calling " + func.__name__)
        func(x)
        print("After calling " + func.__name__)
    return function_wrapper

def foo(x):
    print("Hi, foo has been called with " + str(x))

print("We call foo before decoration:")
foo("Hi")

print("\n  ----- We now decorate foo with f:")
foo = our_decorator(foo)

print("\nWe call foo after decoration:\n")
foo(42)

# If you look at the following output of the previous program, you can see what's going on.
# After the decoration "foo = our_decorator(foo)", foo is a reference to the 'function_wrapper'.
# 'foo' will be called inside of 'function_wrapper', but before and after the call some additional code will be executed,
# i.e. in our case two print functions.

print('\n -----------------  The Usual Syntax for Decorators in Python   ------------------- ')
# The decoration in Python is usually not performed in the way we did it in our previous example,
# even though the notation foo = our_decorator(foo) is catchy and easy to grasp.
# This is the reason, why we used it! You can also see a design problem in our previous approach.
# "foo" existed in the same program in two versions, before decoration and after decoration.
#
# We will do a proper decoration now. The decoration occurrs in the line before the function header.
# The "@" is followed by the decorator function name.
#
# We will rewrite now our initial example. Instead of writing the statement
#                        foo = our_decorator(foo)
# we can write :
#                           @our_decorator
# But this line has to be directly positioned in front of the decorated function. The complete example looks like this now:

def our_decorator(func):
    def function_wrapper(x):
        print("Before calling " + func.__name__)
        func(x)
        print("After calling " + func.__name__)
    return function_wrapper

@our_decorator
def foo(x):                 # Here we decorate our function foo with the function our_decorator
    print("Hi, foo has been called with " + str(x))

foo("Hi")

print('\n----------- Second decorator ---------')

# We can decorate every other function which takes one parameter with our decorator 'our_decorator'.
# We demonstrate this in the following.
# We have slightly changed our function wrapper, so that we can see the result of the function calls:

def our_decorator(func):
    def function_wrapper(x):
        print("Before calling " + func.__name__)
        res = func(x)
        print(res)
        print("After calling " + func.__name__)
    return function_wrapper

@our_decorator
def succ(n):                    # Here we decorate our function succ with the function our_decorator
    return n + 1

succ(10)

print('\n----------- Third decorator but not with @ ---------')

# It is also possible to decorate third party functions, e.g. functions we import from a module.
# We can't use the Python syntax with the "at" sign in this case:

from math import sin, cos

def our_decorator(func):
    def function_wrapper(x):
        print("Before calling " + func.__name__)
        res = func(x)
        print(res)
        print("After calling " + func.__name__)
    return function_wrapper

sin = our_decorator(sin)            # Here we decorate the math.sin function
cos = our_decorator(cos)        # Here we decorate the math.cos function

for f in [sin, cos]:
    f(3.1415)


# Summarizing we can say that a decorator in Python is a callable Python object that is used to modify a function,
# method or class definition. The original object, the one which is going to be modified, is passed to a decorator as an argument.
# The decorator returns a modified object, e.g. a modified function, which is bound to the name used in the definition.

print('\n----------- Fourth decorator but not with @---------')

from random import random, randint, choice

def our_decorator(func):
    def function_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):      # Here **kwargs is not necessarily needed !
        print("Before calling " + func.__name__)
        res = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(res)
        print("After calling " + func.__name__ +"   \n---------------")
    return function_wrapper

for f in [random, randint, choice]:
    f = our_decorator(f)                # Here we decorate the function from the above list

random = our_decorator(random)
randint = our_decorator(randint)
choice = our_decorator(choice)
random()
randint(3, 8)
choice([4, 5, 6])

print('----------------- Checking Arguments with a Decorator ------------------')

# In our chapter about recursive functions we introduced the factorial function.
# We wanted to keep the function as simple as possible and we didn't want to obscure the underlying idea,
# so we hadn't incorporated any argument checks.
# So, if somebody had called our function with a negative argument or with a float argument, our function would have got into an endless loop.

# The following program uses a decorator function to ensure that the argument passed to the function factorial is a positive integer:

def argument_test_natural_number(f):
