def grule( n ):
    """Compute roots and weights for nth degree Legendre polynomial.

    USAGE:
        ( x, w ) = grule( n )

    INPUT:
        n       - degree of Legendre polynomial

    OUTPUT:
        x       - array of roots.  The roots of the polynomial are symmetric
                  about the origin so only the non-negative roots are returned.
	w       - Array of weights.  w[i] is paired with both x[i] and -x[i].

    NOTES:
        I'm no longer sure, but I think this came from A.H. Stroud, and
        Don Secrest, "Gaussian Quadrature Formulas", Prentice-Hall,
        Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1966.  This was taken from FORTRAN
        code (as its appearence suggests).  It was converted to C by
        J. Senning in 1986 (I think...) and then into a MatLab
        (Octave) M file in February 1999.
