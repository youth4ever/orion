    """ Estimate the integral of f(x) from a to b using Gaussian Quadrature.

    USAGE:
        y = gauss_quad( f, a, b, n )

    INPUT:
        f       - function to integrate
        [a, b]  - interval of integration
        n       - number of nodes (points to evaluate at)

    OUTPUT:
        float y - estimate of integral of f(x) from a to b

    NOTES:
        Uses gaussian quadrature to estimate the integral of f from a to b
        using n nodes.  The interval [a,b] is mapped to the interval [-1,1].

        The change in interval is made by the substitution
            t = 2*(x-a)/(b-a)-1 
        where x is in [a,b] and t is in [-1,1].  Solving this for x gives
        x = 0.5*(b-a) * t + 0.5*(b+a).  Thus dx = 0.5*(b-a) * dt.  So

            / b                / 1
            |            (b-a) |
            | f(x) dx  = ----- | f( 0.5*(b-a) * t + 0.5*(b+a) ) dt
            |              2   |
            / a                /-1
