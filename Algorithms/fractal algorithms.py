########## STEP 1 - BUILD THE MAIN LOOP ALGORITHM    ###########
# Build the main loop, the loop which is computing the main position calculations.
# Here these are the powers of 2 :  1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ....
# Assure yourself that FIRST this is working properly

# We start at the position (0,1) after one step:
# We use only standard step sizes of powers of 3 :
n=128

print('\n--------------- STEP 2 -  Introducing RECURSION  ------------------')
########## STEP 2 - Introducing RECURSION       #############
# After having correctly generated all the powers of 2, we can now
# tackle with any number by decomposing it in powers of two and then adding / substracting
# the parts together. Here we will need recursion and recursion is much more handy than iteration
# So we must take the above loop and integrate it into a recursion function which we'll call dragon

    pos = [0,1]

print('\n--------------- STEP 3 -  Implementing MEMOIZATION  ------------------')
########## STEP 2 - Implementing MEMOIZATION       #############
# As we can see above if we print the results in the while loop we have many times
# that the recursing call is calculating the same step numbers. For large computations this
# really slows down the whole calculation. The solution is to implement MEMOIZATION.
# Basically we keep track of the already calculated values and we simply do this by using a
# dictionary as the dictionary is hashed object and is very fast.
# But here it is a little more difficult and not so useful because
# there are not so many recursive calls. It is more difficult because the value n that
# we search is different that the one in the dictionary. So we must choose the closest value
